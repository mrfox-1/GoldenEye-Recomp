# GoldenEye 007 — PC Recompilation

A native PC port of **GoldenEye 007 (Xbox 360 / XBLA)**, built by *statically
recompiling* the original game into C++ with the
[ReXGlue SDK](https://github.com/SunJaycy/GoldenEye-Recomp-rexglue). No emulator —
the game runs as a real native executable.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **This repository contains _no_ game code or assets.** It is only the
> source that wraps the game (menus, hooks, online, post-FX, build
> config). The recompiled game itself is generated on *your* machine from *your
> own legally-obtained copy* of GoldenEye 007. You must own the game.

## Features

- Runs natively on Windows — no emulator, no BIOS.
- Controller support.
- **Online multiplayer** — host or join matches over the internet (LAN, Hamachi,
  playit.gg, or a public server). See [Playing online](#playing-online).
- In-game **pause / settings menu** (ESC): video, resolution, frame limit,
  fullscreen, online setup.
- **Post-FX** filters (brightness, contrast, saturation, vignette, presets…).
- Smooth, stable 60 FPS (recompiled, with GPU-pacing fixes for the original's
  frame timing).

## Download & Play

Grab the latest prebuilt release from the **[Releases](../../releases)** page,
then drop your own GoldenEye 007 game files into the `assets/` folder next to
the `.exe` (the release notes explain exactly what's needed). Run `ge.exe`.

## Playing online

1. One person runs the **[server](https://github.com/SunJaycy/GoldenEye-Recomp-Server)**
   and shares its address + port.
2. Everyone opens **ESC → ONLINE** in the game, enters their **username**, the
   **server address**, the **port**, ticks *Enable online play*, and hits
   **Save & Restart**.
3. Host a match; the others find and join it.

Because players connect *out* to the server, no port-forwarding is needed for
joiners — only the host's server port has to be reachable.

## Building from source (advanced)

Most people should just use the [Releases](../../releases). To build it yourself
you need the recompiler toolchain and your own copy of the game.

**Prerequisites**
- The [ReXGlue SDK](https://github.com/SunJaycy/GoldenEye-Recomp-rexglue) (provides the `rexglue` CLI + runtime).
- CMake 3.25+, a C++23 compiler (MSVC), Python 3.
- Your own GoldenEye 007 XBLA game files, placed in `assets/`.

**Steps**
```sh
# 1. Generate the recompiled game code from your copy (creates generated/).
rexglue codegen --max_jump_table_entries 2048 ge_config.toml

# 2. Configure, pointing at your local ReXGlue SDK checkout.
cmake --preset win-amd64-relwithdebinfo -DREXSDK_DIR=/path/to/GoldenEye-Recomp-rexglue

# 3. Build.
cmake --build --preset win-amd64-relwithdebinfo
```

source lives in [`src/`](src/):
`ge_app` (app + window/menus glue), `ge_menu` (pause/settings menu),
`ge_hooks` (mid-asm fixups), `ge_postfx` (filters). `ge_manifest.toml` /
`ge_config.toml` drive the recompiler.

## Legal

GoldenEye 007 and all related assets are property of their respective rights
holders. This project ships **none** of that — no ROM, XEX, textures, audio, or
recompiled game code. It only automates turning a copy *you already own* into a
PC build. Don't ask for or share game files.
